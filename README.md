### MTN Telecom Customer Analysis with Power BI Visualizations
This project is a telecom data analysis performed using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Plotly, based on a simulated MTN Nigeria customer dataset. The analysis answers 10 core business questions on customer behavior, churn risk, network experience, and product performance. A Power BI dashboard is also included to enhance visual storytelling and allow for deeper stakeholder exploration.

## Project Objective
To provide MTN Nigeria or similar telecom providers with data-driven insights by:

1. Analyzing customer demographics and usage behavior

2. Identifying patterns in churn, payment behavior, and loyalty

3. Evaluating product and network performance

4. Supporting strategic decisions with both code-based analysis and business-friendly visuals

## Dataset Overview
The dataset (telecom_customers.csv) contains 10,000 records with customer-level information including:

# Demographics: Age, Gender, Location

# Subscription Details: Plan type, Validity, Monthly bill

# Usage Metrics: Voice, Data, SMS

# Network Experience: Call drops, Internet speed, Satisfaction

# Behavioral Indicators: KYC status, Payment history, Referrals

## Questions Addressed in the Analysis
# Customer Segmentation
→ Grouping customers by demographics and subscription type.

# Churn Risk
→ Highlighting customers with expired plans, missed payments, or zero usage.

# Top Users & High-Value Customers
→ Identifying the most active and profitable users.

# KYC Compliance Impact
→ Investigating how KYC status relates to defaults.

# Plan Performance
→ Comparing plans based on popularity and revenue generation.

# Network Performance by State
→ Assessing call drop and speed satisfaction across regions.

# Payment Behavior Trends
→ Evaluating modes of payment and payment success rates.

# Customer Support Needs
→ Flagging customers who frequently seek support.

# Loyalty & Referrals
→ Understanding how loyalty tiers relate to referrals and retention.

# Device Usage Patterns
→ Analyzing device type and OS among different customer segments.

## Methodology
# Data Cleaning & Transformation in Jupyter using pandas

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using plotly.express

# Feature Engineering (e.g., churn flags, payment compliance ratios)

# Groupby and Aggregations to summarize patterns

# Visual Insights included within the notebook as interactive plots

## Additional Power BI Dashboard
To make the findings more accessible to non-technical stakeholders, a Power BI dashboard was created. It visualizes key metrics and enables:

# Interactive filtering by region, plan type, and device

# Dynamic KPIs (Total Billed Amount and Average Plan cost)

# Charts including bar plots and pie charts


The Power BI file is included in the repository as MTN_Telecom_Insights.pbix.
